Web Quickstart
==============

Project suitable as a starting point for web applications.

## First Time Setup

This project requires the lastest Rust nightly.

You'll also need to have diesel's cli tool installed to be able to work with the
database:

```
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

## Running

After performing the setup, running the server is pretty simple:

```
cargo run
```
